  Hash Brown Benedict

  Ingredients
  for 2 servings

  2 tablespoons  olive oil, divided
  yellow onion, halved, diced small
  1 ¬Ω teaspoons  Club House¬Æ Paprika
  1 teaspoon  salt
  ¬Ω teaspoon  Club House¬Æ black pepper
  3 cups  potato, frozen, shredded (300 g)
  2 large handfuls fresh spinach
  2 eggs, poached
  fresh chives, for garnish
  HOLLANDAISE SAUCE

  3 large egg yolks
  lemon, juiced
  ¬Ω cup  butter, melted (110 g)
  ¬Ω teaspoon  salt

  Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. When the oil is hot, add the diced onion, Club House paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook onions, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add in frozen shredded potatoes and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes start to turn golden and crisp up a bit.

  Within the skillet, divide the potatoes into two piles and place a large, circular cookie cutter ring around each pile. Scoop any potatoes that are outside of the cookie cutters into the center of the rings. Use a spatula to pat down the piles inside the rings to form patties. Turn heat down to low and cook until bottom of hash browns are crispy. Use tongs to remove cookie cutter rings and carefully flip the hash browns to crisp up the other side. Once crispy, remove from the pan.
  In the same pan, add the baby spinach and wilt down over low heat. Remove spinach from the pan.

  Hollandaise: Place egg yolks and lemon juice in a blender. Blend for 10 seconds, then slowly stream in the hot, melted butter (while blender is still running). Sauce will thicken by the time all of the butter has been added. Blend in salt.

  Assembly: Place a hash brown on each plate. Top with spinach, then a poached egg. Spoon hollandaise over the eggs. Garnish with chives.
  Enjoy!

¬Ω cup  chocolate hazelnut spread (150 g)
1 egg, beaten

Cut the pastry sheets into 9 squares.
Preheat the oven to 400ÀöF (200ÀöC). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Take 1 square and make 5 even cuts crosswise across the center. Do not cut all the way through the edges.
Take 2 fingers and place them under the first cut, then over the next. Repeat until your fingers reach all the way through the square. Use the other hand to feed the farthest corner through the gap your fingers created. Gently pull the corner all the way through to form a braid. Repeat with the rest of the squares.
Transfer the braids to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash.
Bake for 14 minutes, or until golden brown.
